A is the Artist,
Who drew in these pages-
He's not had his hair cut-
For ages and ages.

B is the baby
Who is crowing with joy,
But isn't that diggie
A bad, greedy boy?

C is for Cook
Bow how very absurd,
For such a large cook to cook
Such a small bird

D is for Doctor
Who comes when you're ill
He looks at your tongue,
Then gives you a pill.


E is for Errand Boy,
Who loves to watch dogs fight,
his master’s meat is eaten
by the bow-wows on the right.

F is for Fireman,
This one is very brave,
He's climbed up the ladder
Poor pussy to save.

G  is for Gardener,
His enemies are snails:
He catches them with salt you know,
Then drowns hem in pails.

H is for Horse,
No wonder Cabby smiles ;
It’s only taken three short hours
To travel three long miles.

I is for Italian,
Who is fond of Macaroni
We don't know what his name is
We rather think it's Tony.

J is for Judy
Her husband's name is Punch,
And  together with
dog Toby
They are a happy bunch.

K is for Kitchen Maid,
Who's dropped the buttered scones.
We hope she hasn't hurt herself
Or broken any bones.

L is for Laundress
Her washing's very fine
When Fido fell into the tub
She hung him on the line.

M is for Milkman,
Why is he smiling so?
He likes a rainy day, for then
The milk is sure to grow.

And caught a fearful cold.
