 is America, land of the free.  is a Battle, our soldiers did see.   is a Captain, who led on his men.   is a Drummer Boy, called little Ben.   is the Eagle, that proudly did soar.   is our Flag, that shall wave evermore   is a Gun, that is used in the war.   is for Hard- tack, you scarcely can gnaw.   is for Infantry, who boldly advance.   is for Jig, which the Contrabands dance.   is for Knapsack, they carry along.   is for Lancer, bold, fearless, and strong.
                 is for Monument, to honor the brave.   is for Negro, no longer a slave.   is an Officer, proud of his station.   is the President, who ruled the great nation.
                 is for Quarters, guarded with care.   is Retreat, may you never be there.   is a Sailor, who respected will be.   is a Traitor, that was hung on a tree.   is the Union, our Soldiers did save.   is for Volunteer, noble and brave.   is for War, which we all of us rue.   is a Letter which you must learn too.   is a Youth, who a soldier would go.   is Zouave, who charged on the foe.
