A cat, a dog, and a rat. Put the pig in the jar. Is the bun for me?
Put the wig in the box.
Will you go to bed? Give me my new hat. Mend this pen for me. I like a cup and ball.
Will you have a tart? Look at the red Cow. Do not hurt the Fly. O! what a line Nag!
Is that a new gun ?
Let me fly my kite.
Poor Bob fell in a pit.
See how the Ducks swim.
Give me a knife and fork. Let me comb out my hair. Will you brush my coat. Let us go out to play.
Do not ink your shirt.
I wish I had a nice pear. Here is a fine plum cake. Now be a good child.

A, was an Apple,
And put in a pie,
With ten or twelve others,
All piled up so high.

And B, was tall Biddy, 
Who made the puff paste, 
And put sugar and lemon-peel 
Quite to my taste.


Oy, is a Cheese,
But don’t ask for a slice,
For it serves to maintain
A whole nation of Mice.


D , was Dick Dump,
Who did nothing but eat.
And would leave book and play
For a nice bit of meat.

E, is an Egg
In a basket with more,
Which Jenny will sell
For a shilling a score.

F was a Forester,
Dress’d all in green,
With a Cap of fine fur,
Like a King or a Queen.


And G, was a Greyhound,
As swift as the wind ;
In the race or the course
Left all others behind.

H, was a Hoyden,
Not like you, nor like me,
For she tumbled about
Like the waves of the sea.

I, was the Ice
On which William would skate,
So up went his heels.
And down went his pate.

J, was Joe Jenkins,
Who play’d on the fiddle,
And began twenty tunes,
But left off in the middle.

K , was a Kitten,
Who jump’d at a Cork,
And learn'd to eat mice
Without plate, knife, or fork.


And L, was the Lady,
Who made him so wise;
But he tore her long train,
And she cried out her eyes.


M, was Miss Mira,
Who turn'd in her toes,
And poked down her head
Till her knees met her nose.

And N, Mr. Nobody,
Just come from France,
Said he'd set her upright,
And teach her to dance.


O, a grave Owl:
To look like him,
Tom tried, So he put on a mask,
And sat down by his side.

P, was a Pilgrim,
With a staff in his hand,
Return’d weary and faint
From a far distant land.

Q, was the Queen Of Spades,
I've heard say,
In her black velvet girdle,
Just dress’d for the play.

Here’s Ralph with his Raree-show, 
Calling so loud,
But I’d rather give two-pence
To look at the crowd.

S, was a Soldier
Ready to fly
To kill all the French,
Or to eat a mince pie.

T, was a Traveller,
Hast’ning on while ’twas light,
In the hope of a Cottage
To rest in at night.

And U, an Umbrella,
Saved Bell, t’ other day
From a shower that fell,
Whilst she turn’d the new hay.

V,was a Village,
Where liv’d near the brook
The renown’d Goody Two Shoes,
Who sends you this Book.

W, was a Witch,
Who set off at noon
To visit her Cousin,
The Man in the Moon.

X, was Xantippe,
As you ,ve heart belore;
But not to forget her,
I name her once more.

Y, was a Youth,
Who walk’d in the Park,
And play’d on the Flute,
Till he made the Dogs bark.

Z, was a Zealander,
Whose name was Van Bley:
So here ends my song,
And I wish you Good-day.
